    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Class 1a: A subset expert-labeled sites that were selected to serve as quality control sites (Q sites) in the labelling platform;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Class 1b: Expert-labeled sites not used in the labelling platform for Quality control;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Class 1c: Q control assignments completed by the labelling teams against Class 1a labels;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Class 1d: Sites corresponding to Class 1b sites that were digitized by 1-3 members of the labeling team;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Class 2: Ordinary mapping assignments, represented a single unique site mapped by a single labeller. An exception to this case of one labeller/one label were for those assignment marked as Untrusted, in which case it would have been mapped multiple times until the first approved assignment was completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Class 4: Sites mapped by three separate labellers\n",
    "\n",
    "The catalog provides a range of quality metrics associated with the labels, with the following exceptions;\n",
    "\n",
    "- For Class 1a and 1b, no Qscores are available\n",
    "- For Class 1b, there are 153 sites for which no Rscore is available\n",
    "\n",
    "All labels are preserved in the catalog, as they may be useful for different purposes, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contructing quality-weighted consensus maps to:\n",
    "    1. Assess label uncertainty;\n",
    "    2. Extract pixel-based samples from area of higher certainty\n",
    "- Testing whether additional noisy labels added to training samples improve model performance;\n",
    "- Pass multiple labels for the same location into a model as a form of data-based regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "We provided an example here of one approach for selecting what is likely to be the best label for each site, using the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drop:\n",
    "    - All assignments marked as Untrusted or Rejected;\n",
    "    - No Class 1c labels;\n",
    "- Keep:\n",
    "    - All Class 1a assignments;\n",
    "    - All Class 2 assignments;\n",
    "    - The assignment with the highest Rscore for each site occuring in one or both of the Class 1b and Class 1d samples;\n",
    "    - The assignment with the highest Rscore for each Class 4 site\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative approaches may also be used for finding the best sample, such as using the highest Qscore per sample, or multiple individual Q metrics, e.g. the highest combination of Area and N metrics. It may also be preferrable to take the Class 1c assignment with the highest Qscore or highest Rscore for each Class 1a site, in place of the Class 1a labels."
